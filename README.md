## What is Synthetic Data

The field of synthetic data is still developing, and there is no clear consensus on a unified definition. This lack of a universally accepted definition leads to inconsistent use of the term and varied interpretations, affecting reproducibility and transparency in research involving synthetic data. The Royal Society and The Alan Turing Institute propose that synthetic data is “data generated using a purpose-built mathematical model or algorithm, with the aim of solving a (set of) data science task(s).” This definition emphasizes the functional and intentional aspects of synthetic data, focusing on strategic use rather than mere replication of statistical properties. In clinical settings, synthetic data can be categorized into tabular, time-series, or text-based data, and may also include synthetic images, video, or audio simulations. The classification of synthetic data often represents a spectrum ranging from partially to fully synthetic. Partially synthetic data incorporates real-world data with synthetic data, protecting patient privacy while allowing researchers to conduct analyses. Fully synthetic data is created entirely de novo based on predefined rules, models, or simulations, designed to replicate real-world complexity and variability without relying on real-world data.

***Applications of Synthetic Data in Healthcare***
Synthetic data holds immense potential for healthcare applications, from estimating the benefits of screenings and healthcare policies to augmenting machine learning algorithms for image classification and pre-training models for specific patient populations. It can also improve public health models for predicting outbreaks of infectious diseases.
For example, a study by Davis et al. used synthetic data to investigate healthcare policy implications in the context of demographic aging. By integrating multiple data sources and using imputation techniques, the researchers created a synthetic dataset for microsimulation in healthcare policy analysis. This approach allowed them to evaluate the impact of various policy scenarios on health service outcomes, providing valuable insights for policymakers.
Another study by Julia et al. demonstrated the use of synthetic data in training a Natural Language Processing (NLP) model with synthetic datasets created from patient discharge reports. The model effectively targeted mental health diseases to predict diagnoses and phenotypes. Using synthetic data mitigates the risk of compromising sensitive patient information, particularly in mental health cases.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, synthetic data was instrumental in addressing data scarcity and augmenting imaging studies. Das et al. created conditional synthetic datasets for chest CT scans to classify COVID-19 patients from a population of normal individuals and pneumonia patients. The use of synthetic datasets improved the accuracy of COVID-19 detection compared to original datasets.

***Synthetic Data and Digital Twins***
Synthetic data is also crucial for digital twins, which are virtual replicas of physical systems or processes used to simulate and predict behavior in real-time. In healthcare, digital twins can create personalized models of patients, optimize treatment plans, and improve patient outcomes. One area where digital twins are increasingly used is hospital efficiency and operations. Synthetic data can simulate different scenarios, such as changes in patient volume, staff training levels, and equipment availability, allowing administrators to optimize staffing and resource allocation, reduce costs, and improve patient outcomes.
For example, a hospital digital twin might use synthetic data to simulate an increase in patient volume or a decrease in staff availability. This simulation can help administrators make informed decisions about resource allocation and staffing levels, ensuring that the hospital operates efficiently even under stress. Similarly, creating digital twins of patients can help healthcare providers simulate different treatment options and predict their effectiveness, leading to personalized treatment plans that improve patient outcomes and potentially reduce costs.

***Potential Pitfalls: Bias and Interpretability***
The incorporation of synthetic data in healthcare offers solutions to data scarcity and privacy issues, but it also introduces concerns such as bias amplification, low interpretability, and the need for robust methods to audit data quality.
Bias in synthetic data arises when there is a systematic discrepancy during data sampling or testing, leading to overestimation or underestimation of risks associated with clinical outcomes. If the primary dataset used to generate synthetic data contains inherent biases, these biases can be unintentionally magnified in the synthetic data, resulting in misinformed or discriminatory outcomes in medical research and practice. This bias can stem from the population under study, data collection techniques, or methods used to derive the synthetic dataset.
For instance, if a synthetic dataset is trained on facial images predominantly from a certain ethnicity, the generated images will reflect this imbalance, perpetuating the initial bias. This leads to AI systems being unable to accurately represent or make fair decisions about unrepresented categories, known as the “out-of-distribution” (OOD) problem. AI systems can address this limitation by oversampling under-represented characteristics, but this approach risks overgeneralization and the creation of non-existent correlations.
Bias can also originate from generative methods used to create synthetic datasets. Challenges associated with interpreting synthetic data generation models include the black-box nature of generation algorithms, limitations in evaluation metrics, and potential for overfitting or underfitting. This lack of transparency can erode trust in synthetic data, making it difficult for healthcare professionals and researchers to make reliable conclusions or informed decisions.
Explainable AI (XAI) techniques are crucial for ensuring the interpretability and transparency of AI systems dealing with synthetic data. XAI methods enable users to understand the underlying mechanisms and decision-making processes of AI models, providing insights into input-output relationships and the presence of biases. For example, SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) can interpret predictions made by machine learning models, ensuring transparency and accountability in decision-making. XAI techniques can assess if synthetic data maintains desired input-output relationships similar to real data, helping identify biases and evaluate representativeness.

***Auditing Synthetic Data Quality***
Ensuring the quality and representativeness of synthetic data requires robust auditing methods. Conventional techniques may inadequately capture the complexity and diversity of real-world medical scenarios, necessitating the development of novel auditing methods. Advanced statistical techniques and machine learning models can assess the similarity between synthetic and real-world datasets. Techniques such as distribution matching, correlation analysis, and dimensionality reduction can capture intricate correlations and patterns, enhancing data representativeness.
Creating domain-specific evaluation metrics and benchmark datasets tailored for healthcare applications is another strategy. By curating benchmarks representing a wide spectrum of real-world medical scenarios, researchers can effectively compare the performance of synthetic data generation techniques. Involving patients and healthcare professionals in the development and validation of synthetic data ensures its relevance and representativeness.
Transparency in documenting the data generation process, potential limitations, and data biases helps identify actual and potential errors. Balancing the benefits of synthetic data with challenges of bias, interpretability, and data quality audits is crucial for prioritizing patient well-being and maintaining ethical standards in healthcare.

***Privacy Concerns and Regulatory Agencies***
Synthetic data poses significant risks to data privacy and protection. As noted in recent reviews, privacy should not be an afterthought but a proactive consideration, particularly when dealing with clinical data. The primary challenge is ensuring that synthetic data derived from sensitive medical information does not unintentionally disclose identifiable details about individuals or lead to re-identification, violating privacy and data protection principles.

***Regulatory Blind Spots and Proposals***
There is no clear legislation surrounding the use of synthetic data, and existing regulations have limitations in addressing potential risks. The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) require consent for data processing, but they do not fully cover the nuances of synthetic data. The GDPR refers to “personal data” and includes any information related to an identifiable individual, while HIPAA focuses on de-identified data, which may still be subject to re-identification risks.
HIPAA identified 18 items that, when removed, are deemed sufficient to de-identify data. However, recent studies have shown that other data fields can also be used to identify individuals. The GDPR expands the scope of protected information, including physiological, genetic, mental, and cultural identifiers. GDPR delineates two forms of data de-identification: pseudonymization and anonymization, but achieving full anonymization is challenging and offers minimal analytical value.

***Establishing a Digital Chain of Custody***
To ensure data integrity, security, and privacy throughout the lifecycle of synthetic data, a robust digital chain of custody is essential. This involves tracking data from generation to final disposal, documenting methodologies, privacy-preserving measures like differential privacy, and ensuring secure data sharing, storage, and disposal.
Blockchain technology can enhance the chain of custody by providing a decentralized and immutable ledger that records data transactions. For example, a blockchain-based big-data sharing system (BBS) can document the sequence of custody of sensitive data, ensuring transparency and traceability. A digital chain of custody should start with the generation of synthetic data, documenting methodologies and techniques used. During data sharing, secure processes should be established for transferring synthetic data between parties, including encryption, secure authentication, and access control mechanisms. Each data-sharing transaction should be logged, detailing the sender, receiver, timestamp, and purpose. For data storage, synthetic data should be securely stored using encryption and access control mechanisms, with regular audits to confirm compliance with data protection standards. For data disposal, a clear protocol should be in place for secure deletion or destruction of synthetic data, using secure erasure methods and maintaining disposal records.
Implementing a digital chain of custody ensures data integrity, security, and accountability, providing transparency and traceability at each stage. Regulatory measures should mandate comprehensive research proposal evaluations before granting access to synthetic data, requiring timed-release updates on analysis progress and usage, fostering transparency and responsible research practices.
