# The Role of Synthetic Data in Healthcare

Data-driven decision-making underpins innovation and predictive analytics in healthcare, much like in finance and economics, where synthetic data has improved risk assessment and algorithmic trading. Despite its potential, synthetic data in healthcare faces unique challenges due to higher stakes, potential liabilities, and practitioner distrust. This blog explores the benefits and limitations of synthetic data in healthcare, highlighting its role in enhancing data privacy, augmenting datasets for predictive analytics, and informing government policy. We will also delve into future applications, such as digital twin technology, and discuss the issues of data quality, bias, and privacy. Lastly, we will experiment with creating synthetic images.

## Introduction

Data is the lifeblood of modern healthcare, driving improvements in patient care, powering clinical research, and advancing public health initiatives. The promise of real-world data to enable personalized medical care, guide policymaking, and respond to rapidly changing conditions is often hindered by challenges in accessing high-quality datasets. Synthetic data presents an attractive alternative, addressing privacy concerns, streamlining data utility agreements, protocol submissions, ethics review approvals, and reducing costs.
While synthetic data has been successfully utilized in fields like finance and economics for risk management and algorithmic trading, its application in healthcare is more complex. Healthcare stakeholders are risk-averse, and the stakes for patients and providers are high. There is also a preference for precise replication of original healthcare records, and a general distrust in AI-based predictions using synthetic data. This blog will explore the generation techniques, applications, and definitions of synthetic data in healthcare, along with associated privacy issues and strategies to mitigate harm, ultimately aiming to harness the full potential of synthetic data in advancing medical research and patient care.

## What is Synthetic Data

The field of synthetic data is still developing, and there is no clear consensus on a unified definition. This lack of a universally accepted definition leads to inconsistent use of the term and varied interpretations, affecting reproducibility and transparency in research involving synthetic data. The Royal Society and The Alan Turing Institute propose that synthetic data is “data generated using a purpose-built mathematical model or algorithm, with the aim of solving a (set of) data science task(s).” This definition emphasizes the functional and intentional aspects of synthetic data, focusing on strategic use rather than mere replication of statistical properties.
In clinical settings, synthetic data can be categorized into tabular, time-series, or text-based data, and may also include synthetic images, video, or audio simulations. The classification of synthetic data often represents a spectrum ranging from partially to fully synthetic. Partially synthetic data incorporates real-world data with synthetic data, protecting patient privacy while allowing researchers to conduct analyses. Fully synthetic data is created entirely de novo based on predefined rules, models, or simulations, designed to replicate real-world complexity and variability without relying on real-world data.
